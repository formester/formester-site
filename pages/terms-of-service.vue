    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <br />
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      By using the Formester.com web site (the "Site"), you are agreeing to be
      bound by the following terms and conditions ("Terms of Service").
    </p>
    <p>
      Formester.com ("Formester") provides online form creation, storage and
      team notification features. The Site provides form templates, user
      friendly guides, website code, and back-end notification features,
      including options for integrating forms into existing websites and tools
      for delineating required information within forms (the "Service").
    </p>
    <p>
      Formester reserves the right to update and change the Terms of Service
      from time to time without notice. Any new features that augment or enhance
      the Site, including the release of new tools and resources relating to the
      Service, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the
      Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such
      changes. Formester makes no representation or warranty that any
      information provided, regardless of its source (the "Content"), is
      accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your
      Account. While Formester prohibits illegal conduct and Content on the
      Site, you understand and agree that Formester cannot be responsible for
      the Content posted on the Site and you nonetheless may be exposed to such
      materials. You agree to use the Site and Service at your own risk.
    </p>

    <h2>Account Terms</h2>
    <p>
      You must be 13 years or older to use this Site and Service. You may use
      our Service only if you can form a binding contract with Formester, and
      only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws. If you open
      an account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a)
      "you" includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that
      you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in these
      Terms and bind the entity to these Terms, and that you agree to these
      Terms on the entity's behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must be a human. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated
      methods are not permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must provide a valid, accurate email address and any other information
      requested in order to complete the signup process.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and
      password. Formester cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage
      from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for all Content posted and activity that occurs under
      your account.
    </p>
    <p>
      One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one free account.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You
      must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction
      (including but not limited to copyright laws).
    </p>

    <h2>API Terms</h2>
    <p>
      Customers may access their Formester account data via an API (Application
      Program Interface). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a
      third-party product that accesses Formester, is bound by the terms of this
      agreement plus the following specific terms:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        You expressly understand and agree that Formester shall not be liable
        for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or
        exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of
        profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if
        Formester has been advised of the possibility of such damages),
        resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access
        data via the API. Further limitations and clarifications of Formester's
        liability are found below in the sections titled "WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS"
        AND "LIMITATION OF LIABILITY."
      </li>
      <li>
        Abusive or excessively frequent requests to Formester via the API may
        result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access
        to the API. Formester, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or
        excessive usage of the API. Formester will make a reasonable attempt via
        email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.
      </li>
      <li>
        Formester reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue,
        temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part thereof)
        with or without notice.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms</h2>
    <p>
      All paid plans must enter a valid credit card. Free accounts are not
      required to provide credit card details.
    </p>
    <p>
      An upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan will immediately bill
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable.
      There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service,
      upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open
      account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing
      authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes,
      levies, or duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card that you
      provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing
      cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or
      capacity of your Account. Formester does not accept any liability for such
      loss. For more information about liability limitations, see our sections
      below titled "Warranty Disclaimer" and "Limitation of Liability".
    </p>

    <h2>Cancellation and Termination</h2>
    <p>
      Formester, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate
      your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service,
      or any other Formester service, for any reason at any time. Such
      termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of
      your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and
      relinquishment of all Content in your Account. Formester reserves the
      right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>Modifications to the Service and Prices</h2>
    <p>
      Formester reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify
      or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part
      thereof) with or without notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prices of all Service, including but not limited to monthly subscription
      plan fees to the Service, are subject to change upon 30-day's notice from
      us. Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to the
      Formester Site (https://formester.com/terms-of-service/) or the Service
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formester shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any
      modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Copyright, Intellectual Property Rights and Content Ownership</h2>
    <p>
      We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to
      the Service. Your profile and materials uploaded remain yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formester does not pre-screen Content, but Formester and its designee have
      the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to refuse or
      remove any Content that is available via the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS,
      Javascript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written
      permission from Formester. You may not use the Formester name without
      express written permission from Formester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formester respects the intellectual property of others and asks that users
      of our Services do the same. Formester is not responsible for content on
      other web sites that you may find or access when using Formester products
      or Services. Content available on or through other web sites may be
      protected by copyright and the intellectual property laws of the United
      States and/or other countries. With respect to your use of such content,
      the terms of use of those web sites, and not the Formester Terms of
      Service, govern.
    </p>

    <h2>General Conditions</h2>

      Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The service is provided on
      an "as is" and "as available" basis.

    <p>
      Technical support is only provided to paying account holders and is only
      available via email.
    </p>
    <p>
      You understand that Formester uses third party vendors and hosting
      partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage,
      and related technology required to run the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must not modify, adapt or hack the Service or modify another website
      so as to falsely imply that it is associated with the Service, Formester,
      or any other Formester service.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any
      portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service
      without the express written permission by Formester.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may, but have no obligation to, remove Content and Accounts containing
      Content that we determine in our sole discretion are unlawful, offensive,
      threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene or otherwise
      objectionable or violates any party's intellectual property or these Terms
      of Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or
      retribution) of any Formester customer, employee, member, or officer will
      result in immediate account termination.
    </p>
    <p>
      You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the
      Service, including your Content, may be transferred unencrypted and
      involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to
      conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or
      devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must not upload, post, host, or transmit unsolicited email, SMSs, or
      "spam" messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must not transmit any worms or viruses or any code of a destructive
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your bandwidth usage exceeds 500 MB/month, or significantly exceeds the
      average bandwidth usage (as determined solely by Formester) of other
      Formester customers, we reserve the right to immediately disable your
      account or throttle your hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth
      consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      The failure of Formester to exercise or enforce any right or provision of
      the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
      provision. The Terms of Service constitutes the entire agreement between
      you and Formester and govern your use of the Service, superseding any
      prior agreements between you and Formester (including, but not limited to,
      any prior versions of the Terms of Service).
