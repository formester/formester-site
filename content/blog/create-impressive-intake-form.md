## Pro tips for producing an effective intake form

### 1. Start with a compelling introduction

The introduction of your intake form is the most important part. It’s where you should get straight to the point and explain why this form is important to you, as well as what information you need from your client in order to best serve them.

In addition to providing an overview of your organization or yourself, it’s also a good idea to explain what exactly will happen if they fill out your intake form and how that would benefit them (or others). This might sound like an obvious statement, but many people forget about this step!

### 2. Use a personalized and friendly tone

You can make your intake form take on an impressive appearance by using a personalized and friendly tone. This will help you create a more comfortable environment for the client, and they're much more likely to fill out your forms if they feel they're in good hands. When writing the questions, try not to use complex jargon. This could get some clients frustrated.

### 3. Provide a reason for them to fill out the form

It's essential to explain why your intake form is necessary and how it will benefit the client. If you can show them that their information will be used in a way that benefits them, they are more likely to fill out the form.

### 4. Sometimes remember less is more

This is the most important thing to keep in mind when creating your intake form: asking for too much information will just make you look like a data miner or potential spammer! In other words, ask only what's needed to provide the service or product that you're offering.

## Basic questions to consider

It is natural that when you first consider to include an intake form in your website, blog or share it across your social media accounts, you might be at a loss. That’s when it's ideal (and even a safe bet) to include the most obvious and basic questions. You could ask:
- Your client’s name.
- Their age.
- Their gender.
- Phone number.
- Email address. 

## Go deeper

Once you are done with the basics, it’s time to consider asking questions that will help you to get to know your client in detail.

- Ask the scope of the project they would like you to undertake or the service you can provide.
- It’s also advisable to check with your client if they have worked with any other businesses who provide the same services such as yourself. (This may help you know your competitors).
- If a client has been referred by another provider or organization, it will be helpful to ask them questions about their previous experiences with other providers. (This gives you insight into what kind of services they expect and how best you can offer them the best experience).


## Winning points in a nutshell

- Keep it simple, use a single page, and make it easy to read.
- Don't make the client scroll; use graphics and images when needed.
- Use conversational language rather than complex terms.
- Be upfront about how you’ll use their information, who will have access to it, and what they can do if they have concerns or need assistance.
