**\*The mirror:** [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/), O Queen (Web form Users), creates the prettiest forms of all.*

Sure, it does Queen (dear users)! But then, what brings you here?

## Why Are Users Looking For Typeform Alternatives?

Reliability Concerns 6. Clunky User Interface](/img/why-are-users-looking-for-typeform-alternatives.png "Why Are Users Looking For Typeform Alternatives? ")

**1. Tedious Setup Process:** Many users find setting up surveys on Typeform to be a cumbersome and time-consuming task, which can be frustrating when they have limited time for survey creation.

**2. Submission Limitations:** Users have expressed frustration with Typeform's free version, as **it imposes a strict limit of 10 free submissions**. This can be problematic, especially when a significant amount of time is invested in creating surveys, only to be met with this submission restriction.

**3. Slow Customer Support:** Some users have reported sluggish customer support from Typeform. When encountering issues or needing assistance, slow response times can hinder progress and lead to frustration.

**4. Misleading Advertisements:** Typeform has been criticized for advertising features that may not actually exist or are not as robust as implied. This discrepancy can lead to user disappointment and a sense of being misled.

**5. Reliability Concerns:** While Typeform is known for its visually appealing forms, some users have experienced issues with reliability, such as forms crashing or not functioning as expected. This can disrupt data collection and compromise survey outcomes.

**6. Clunky User Interface:** The user interface (UI) of Typeform has been described as clunky by some users. Additionally, there are instances where the UI may take a considerable amount of time to load results, especially when dealing with a large number of responses, leading to frustration.
