## Steps to Build Your Online Form Using Formester

Let’s now begin with a stepwise guide to creating your online form. In our discussion, we will share the numerous touchpoints you need to know for [building your first form with Formester](https://formester.com/blog/building-your-first-form-with-formester/ "Build your first form with Formester") .

### Step 1: Determine Your Data Collection Requirements

Find out your objectives with the form or survey. What do you need to ask your users? What are the different types of data you aim to collect? Conceptualize your form design and form fields. Also, figure out if you want a standalone form to share via links or integrate it into your website as per your application requirements.

Remember to keep it short, simple, and effective. Put yourself in the user’s or respondent’s shoes - think about why you would want to fill out this form or answer this survey, and optimize for a delightful user experience.

### Step 2: Sign Up and Begin With the Form Heading

If you don’t have an account already - sign up to [Formester: Easy HTML form builder](https://formester.com/ "Formester") and create your first form.

Before you structure your form, you need to give it a suitable form name and enter a few details:

* **Redirect URL:** The site address where you want the respondents to land up after submitting your form.
* **Email notifications:** The email addresses that you want to use for receiving submission notifications.
* **Type of service:** Choose drag and drop to create your forms unless you’re just looking for backend services only and have your online form in place.

## Step 3: Choose Form Fields and Add Them to Your Form

Once you create a form and enter the form name along with other primary details – it’s now time to build exactly what your audience would be interacting with. Choose from a huge variety of form fields as per your requirements and objective with the form or survey.

For example - for building a lead generation form, you would need basic client details like their name, email address, contact details, business requirements, the industry they operate in, and more. Subsequently, you can choose from different form fields in terms of the type of data (text, multiple-choice, numerical, URL, email address, date, rating etc).
