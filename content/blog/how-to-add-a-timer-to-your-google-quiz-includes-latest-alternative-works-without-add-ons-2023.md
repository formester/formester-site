Web forms are becoming a rapidly growing means of data-collection.

Whether it's a business or an educational institute, [every entity has its unique application of web forms](https://formester.com/blog/web-forms-how-and-where-to-use-them-for-your-business/).

## Time-Bound Online Forms

Forms created and published over an online platform, such as a website, are known as Online Forms.

Introducing a time limit, i.e., a start time and a finish time for such a web form, renders a Time-Bound Online Form.

In case of businesses, there are several occasions, such as:

* Event Registration 
* Product Pre-launch Registrations
* Survey data collection based on a specific time duration, etc.

which require setting a time limit on web forms.

Whilst in an academic context, this translates as:

* Online academic quizzes
* Assignment Submissions based on deadlines
* Program registrations, etc.

If you clicked on this blog, chances are highly likely that you are a teacher who wants to [administer online quizzes](https://formester.com/blog/how-to-create-a-quiz-in-google-forms-the-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-need-in-2023-1/);

Without compromising on the [supervision and accountability factors](https://www.kumon.co.uk/blog/benefits-of-timing-my-childs-work/).

The utilization of online platforms, such as Google Forms, doesn't come without compromises.

It's a known fact that the supervision and management administered in a physical setting, can't be matched in a virtual or online one.

But at the same time, it is also safe to say that such platforms are working rapidly towards developing features that enable and enhance such factors that ensure and improve reliability and fairness.

A time-bound online quiz allows a specific amount of time for quiz completion, making it difficult for learners to cheat;

And therefore, proves to be an effective means of administering fairness and quick thinking, ultimately ensuring reliable and more accurate quiz results.
