Honestly, how many weekends have you spent not going out with your friends, and instead,

Taking an [online quiz to find out what kind of pizza are you](https://www.buzzfeed.com/justinabarca/my-veins-pump-pizza)?

![Infographic showing:- Funny meme representing peoples' interest in Online Entertainment Quizzes](/img/use-as-needed-14-.png "Peoples' interest in Online Entertainment Quizzes")

Or, have you ever taken one of those career quizzes, which help you determine which career would best suit you?

Or, are you a teacher, who wants to make the most out of [E-Learning softwares and tools](https://www.softwareadvice.com/lms/elearning-authoring-comparison/), using online quizzes, for tutoring and assessing your students?

![Infographic showing:- 6 Popular Types of Online Quizzes, namely: Academic/ educational quizzes, Buzzfeed- style quizzes, Personality quizzes, Lead- generation quizzes, Trivia quizzes and Picture/ video quizzes](/img/light-blue-doodle-illustration-company-values-graph-1-.png "6 Popular Types of Online Quizzes")

Regardless of the category you relate to, ever wondered how you can create such quizzes yourself?

Today we discuss, one such platform which enables this, and that platform is…

## Google Forms

Developed and integrated as a part of the [free, web-based Google Docs Editors suite](https://www.google.com/docs/about/), it is offered by the [Big Tech, Google](https://about.google/).

[Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/), as the name itself suggests, is essentially a form builder tool enabling its users to create various kinds of web forms, including surveys, questionnaires, quizzes and more, online and free of cost, to collect, organize, manage and analyze the information they gather. 

It has several quality features, making it a popular choice, both amongst business professionals and individual users.

![Infographic showing:- Main features of Google Forms, namely: Online Quizzes, Event Registration, Polls, Analytics with Graphs & Charts, Instant Results, Media Uploads and Safe & Secure](/img/main-features-of-google-forms.png "Main features of Google Forms")

So without further adieu, let's get you started with,

## Creating A Quiz Using Google Forms in 6 simple steps

As intuitive and easy to use, as it may seem, the process is deserving of a definitive guide, for both first-time users as well as those looking to create advanced quizzes using more complex features.

### Step 1 - Create/Sign-in to your Google account and visit Google Forms  

Start by logging in to your existing Google account, or create one if you haven’t already.

Then, [click here, to visit the official Google Forms website](https://docs.google.com/forms).

![Image showing Google Forms' Sign-in Page](/img/use-as-needed-3-.png "Google Forms Sign-in Page")

### Step 2- Create a New Form

You will see a page as below, after step 1. 

At the top right corner, under the **Start a New Form** Section, click on the **plus (+)** icon over the Blank Form Template.

![Image showing the **Start a New Form** Section and the **plus (+)** icon on the Blank Form Template](/img/use-as-needed-4-.png "**Start a New Form** Section and the **plus (+)** icon on the Blank Form Template")

You now have a blank form ready to edit.

### Step 3 - Form Title and Settings

Click on **Untitled Form**, and rename it as per a suitable title.

You may also choose to give a little **background or description about your quiz**.

For e.g., if it's a test, you may brief about the marking scheme as regards the different sections, with the responders best of luck, etc.

![Image showing **Untitled Form** and **Quiz Description** section](/img/use-as-needed-5-.png "**Untitled Form** and **Quiz Description** section")

Next, in the top header, you'll find three buttons, namely: 

* Questions, 
* Responses, and 
* Settings

Click on the **Settings** button and toggle the **Make this a quiz** feature.

![Image showing the **Make this a quiz** toggle under the **Settings** section](/img/use-as-needed-6-.png " **Make this a quiz** feature")

You can set up additional settings depending upon the nature or intent of the quiz, such as educational, entertainment, survey, etc.

### Step 4 - Adding Questions to Your Quiz

After you've selected the appropriate settings for your quiz, you may switch back to the **Question** Tab.

By default, there will be an **Untitled Question** section, which marks the beginning of your quiz questions.

You may start by adding your first question here;

or you may make it into an introductory field asking for the respondent's name.

> Pro Tip: You may set some fields as **compulsory/required**, such as the ones above.

![Image showing **Untitled Question** section under **Question Tab** and set as **Required** toggle](/img/use-as-needed-7-.png "**Untitled Question** section under **Question Tab** and set as **Required** toggle")

From the **drop-down menu** (by default showing multiple choice), 

You may also **set up the kind of response** you want to receive, such as short answer, multiple choice, etc.

You also get to **upload images**, as and when required.

![Image showing **Feature Panel**, **Add New Fields** and **Duplicate** buttons](/img/use-as-needed-8-.png " **Feature Panel**, **Add New Fields** and **Duplicate** buttons")

A small **Feature Panel** on the right side has several other feature buttons.

At the top is again a **plus (+)** button. This button allows you to **Add New Fields** to your forms.

Or you may simply click on the **Duplicate** button to have the same template and edit it as per your next question.

### Step 5 - Add your Custom Grading Scheme

Once you've added your questions and answers, you can also add your custom grading system.

C﻿hoose the **correct response**.

![Image showing the **correct response** being selected](/img/use-as-needed-10-.png "C﻿hoose the **correct response**")

You may also **Add an answer/feedback** explaining why a given response was correct or incorrect or any other additional information about the response.

You may also **add videos**/ **video URLs** for the same.

![Image showing the **Add a feedback** section expanded and **Add videos**/ ** Add video URL** buttons](/img/use-as-needed-15-.png "**Add a feedback** section expanded and **Add videos**/ ** Add video URL** buttons")

### Step 6 - Preview and Publish

Once you've added all your questions and their answer keys, click on the **eye button** in the top header to get a **preview** of your quiz.

After the preview, just click on the **Send** button to **publish** your quiz.

![Image showing the **eye button** for preview and the **Send** button for publishing the quiz](/img/use-as-needed-12-.png "**Eye button** and **Send** button")

After you've received submissions, you may head over to the **Responses** section to analyze your responders' performance.

![Image showing the **Responses** section expanded including **Question Tab**, **Individual Tab** and **Link to Integrate with Google Sheets**](/img/use-as-needed-13-.png "The **Responses** section, **Question Tab**, **Individual Tab** and **Link to Integrate with Google Sheets**")

Under the Responses section, there is a **Question Tab**, where you find how your responders' have answered each of your questions, while;

The **Individual Tab** will let you see each of your responders' individual responses.

## E-Learning And Online Quizzes 

Although the pandemic contributed significantly towards the increase of e-learning, the use of virtual platforms and tools, via the Internet, for imparting education isn't just a day-old concept. 

Infact, [online learning can be dated back to 1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_learning_in_higher_education#:~:text=Online%20learning%20emerged%20in%201982,education%20program%20to%20business%20executives.).

According to the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/coronavirus-education-global-covid19-online-digital-learning/) - **Even before COVID-19, there was already high growth and adoption in education technology, with global edtech investments reaching US$18.66 billion in 2019 and the overall market for online education projected to reach $350 Billion by 2025.** 

Having said this, it is evident that diverse efforts are being made to develop softwares, tools, services, platforms, apps and more to facilitate Online Learning.

Google Forms is one such software;

And we want to do our bit, by providing you with 

### A few tips and tricks that come in handy when creating an Educational Quiz:
