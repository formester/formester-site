Don't judge a book by its cover;

but do judge a business by its website;

But wait, it's not us; it's Science. 

![An infographic showing important statistics about websites, first impressions and human behaviour](/img/img-1.png "An infographic showing important statistics about websites, first impressions and human behaviour")

According to statistics by [MovableInk](https://movableink.com/blog/29-incredible-stats-that-prove-the-power-of-visual-marketing) - **90% of the information processed by the brain is visual**, and,

**People remember 65% of what they see, compared to ten percent of what they hear**.

And if that data doesn't suffice, guess what [cxl](https://cxl.com/blog/first-impressions-matter-the-importance-of-great-visual-design/) has to say - **visual appeal can be assessed within 50 ms, suggesting that you have about 50 ms to make a good first impression with your website**. 

Well, all this isn't here to scare you;

But when was the last time you checked your website's [digital experience](https://www.liferay.com/resources/l/digital-experience)?

Let alone that, ever wondered how your users feel about it?

![A good user experience can actually make you more money!](/img/no-one-websites-after-creating-their-first-survey-forms.png "A good user experience can actually make you more money!")

Read on as we answer,

## How You Can Find out about your Website's User Experience?

User experience on a website refers to the kind of interface experience your website visitors and clients have, when they are browsing and/or navigating through your website via the website itself, a mobile app or while using the company's digital products or services. 

Quite naturally, the richness of user experience depends on a combination of various elements such as user interface, usability, content and visual appeal, navigation, accessibility, and more. 

There could be plenty of places on your website which could be key selling points, such as unique features, convincing prices, appealing content and visuals, but;

you could be missing out on actually selling those, simply if your users are having a hard time exploring them.

Having said this, who could you approach to enhance your website's user experience? No wonder, the user himself!

And in doing so, [we are here to assist you](https://formester.com/)!

## The 7 Most Important Types of Questions to Ask In a Website Usability Survey

Also, the menu should be available without much hassle, from any point on the website.

> Survey Design Tip 1: Keep your survey short and simple. Too many questions are likely to [bore the respondent](https://cooltool.com/blog/too-long-and-too-boring-questionnaires-what-to-do-with-them-).

### 2. Navigation 

This aspect relates to the interconnectedness, and the placement and positioning of the various elements facilitating this interconnectedness, throughout the website.

This includes links, accessibility to the main menu, homepage, contact information, search field, pagination, tags, breadcrumbs, etc.

### 3. Content and Visual Comprehensibility

**Content is still the king**; No wonder they invented [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/product). 

Not only is this important for user experience, but also for the Google crawlers to understand, rate and rank your website.

Your website and web pages should feature relevant, coherent and easily comprehensible information. 

Also, the visuals, graphics and imagery used, should be in accordance with the content.

The idea is to provide the user with the required and right information, in a quick yet interesting fashion.

![An infographic showing main elements of content and visual appeal, namely, clear and correct information, interesting presentation, enabling quick grasping, concise and relevant](/img/4.png "An infographic showing main elements of content and visual appeal")

### 4. Performance and Compatibility

This aspect relates to your website's performance in terms of loading speed and device compatibility.

In the age of smartphones and tablets, it is only sensible to have your website optimized for all kinds of devices (Well, obviously not the fax machine).

Ideally, your website should load within 0-2 seconds of clicking.

Also, your website should function smoothly on all kinds of devices, following appropriate dimensions. 

This means the content shouldn't get cut, the scrolling function is smooth and the website doesn't crash when used on any of the devices in question. 

Pro Tip: Run a [quick and free technical SEO audit for your website](https://www.seoptimer.com/) to find out more about this!

![An infographic showing main elements of performance and compatibility, namely, page loading speed, device compatibility, site architecture, scrolling functions and content and graphic alignment](/img/white-modern-illustration-creative-process-graph-6-.png "An infographic showing main elements of performance and compatibility")

> Survey Design Tip 4: Make sure you [ask only one question at a time](https://formester.com/blog/top-eight-survey-questions-to-ask/); the more direct a question is, the simpler it is to answer.

### 5. Payments and Subscriptions

If your website offers products, services and subscriptions, which require fetching payments from your users, then facilitating [safe, secure, transparent and prompt transaction methods](https://formester.com/features/online-payment/) is your prime responsibility.

Your website should enable the use of more than one popular payment method.

Also, if any third-party redirects are in practice, their credibility and trustworthiness should not be under question. 

![An infographic showing main elements of payments and subscriptions, namely, safe and secure, transparent, prompt, third-party integrations and credible](/img/5.png "An infographic showing main elements of payments and subscriptions")

10. On a scale of 1-10, how easily were you able to access your invoices, transaction IDs and order history, from your account?  

> Survey Design Tip 5: Make sure the user's responses are saved; in the event that the user wasn't able to complete the form in one go, they would be happy to return if their previous responses have been recorded and they don't have to repeat the entire process. 

### 6. Accessibility

Accessibility isn't just about the inclusion of the specially abled.

It is, infact, about introducing [ease of use, for one and all](https://www2.stardust-testing.com/en/why-web-accessibility-important). 

This involves working with features such as font, color, contrast and brightness adjustments, structured headings, usage of alt text and closed captions, etc.

It doesn't have to be extravagant; reward points, discounts, social media mentions, etc., act as feasible rewards and help make your users feel valued.

### 7. General/Miscellaneous

This aspect deals with the [overall website experience](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-experience.html).

You may use these questions to gather data about the general user experience throughout their session.

You may also take this section as the opportunity to collect valuable suggestions and feedback from your users about anything related to your website.
