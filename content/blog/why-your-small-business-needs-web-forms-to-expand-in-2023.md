The most crucial functionality a web form offers any business is data collection. 

Web forms are the most [efficient means of gathering user data, digitally](https://datascope.io/en/blog/benefits-of-using-digital-forms-for-data-collection/).

They are designed to carry out data collection over a range of domains, such as

A Lead generation web form is designed to collect information from your website visitors.

These website visitors are people who have shown interest or curiosity toward your product/service.

The obtained lead information, is stored in a CRM system and can be used to create personalized experiences for them and have a greater opportunity of turning them into customers. 

### 3. Emailing List

Web forms of any kind cater to collecting atleast basic contact information such as email addresses.

This can be converted into an emailing list, which in turn serves several purposes, such as:

* Personalized Marketing
* Promotions
* Advertising
* Offers and Discounts
* Newsletters
* Blog subscriptions, etc.

An [extensive email list](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/importance-building-email-list/#:~:text=Email%20lists%20are%20important%20because,customers%20than%20Facebook%20or%20Twitter.) comes with plenty of benefits.

### 4. Payment Integrations

Your web forms can be integrated with several [third-party payment gateways](https://formester.com/features/online-payment/) like PayPal, Stripe, etc., so you can start receiving payments, without having to incur the cost rendered by an e-commerce website.

All you have to do is collect payments!

### 5. Business Process Automation

Having a web form on your website solves a lot of problems that come with manual operations and labour.

You are more likely to gather accurate and error-free information, since it is directly being entered by the users themselves.

Also, it eliminates the transmission errors which occur when using a phone/IVR.

Moreover, your users will be more well-equipped to communicate with you, as they have the choice of written presentation.

They can also provide the proper context, reason for contact, and any other additional information that has a chance of being overlooked.

The other aspect of automation comes into play, when you have to respond to your users, after receiving any submission.

Acknowledging the response from your customers and showing them gratitude, for reaching out to you, is a small gesture that goes a long way.

And you don't have to be on this job, 24/7. Web-form Auto-Responders, automate this process for you.

Setting up an auto-responder helps you send out instant acknowledgment messages and keep your users, informed and engaged.

Moreover, with form-builders like Formester, you get Auto-Responders that allow you to curate personalized acknowledgment messages/emails.

Thereby, increasing resource efficiency and conservation.

### 6. Platform Integrations

As a business, it is understandable that you don't just deal with web forms and [work with multiple third-party platforms and applications](https://formester.com/integrations/) to fulfil your business needs.

You'd be delighted to know that web forms can be easily integrated with such platforms, using technologies such as Zapier integration.

This includes integration with Google Sheets for data storage, Slack for communication, Salesforce, and many more.
