      Collection The most crucial functionality a web form offers any business
      is data collection. Web forms are the most efficient means of gathering
      user data, digitally. They are designed to carry out data collection over
      a range of domains, such as customer feedback product reviews product
      surveys suggestions customer inquiries FAQs Survey forms, contact forms,
      Feedback forms, etc., will effectively meet your needs, in this regard. 2.
      Lead Generation and Customer Acquisition If you know about the concept of
      a Sales Funnel, you might be aware of the importance of lead generation. A
      Lead generation web form is designed to collect information from your
      website visitors. These website visitors are people who have shown
      interest or curiosity toward your product/service. The obtained lead
      information, is stored in a CRM system and can be used to create
      personalized experiences for them and have a greater opportunity of
      turning them into customers. 3. Emailing List Web forms of any kind cater
      to collecting atleast basic contact information such as email addresses.
      This can be converted into an emailing list, which in turn serves several
      purposes, such as: Personalized Marketing Promotions Advertising Offers
      and Discounts Newsletters Blog subscriptions, etc. An extensive email list
      comes with plenty of benefits. 4. Payment Integrations Your web forms can
      be integrated with several third-party payment gateways like PayPal,
      Stripe, etc., so you can start receiving payments, without having to incur
      the cost rendered by an e-commerce website. 5. Business Process Automation
      Having a web form on your website solves a lot of problems that come with
      manual operations and labour. You are more likely to gather accurate and
      error-free information, since it is directly being entered by the users
      themselves. Also, it eliminates the transmission errors which occur when
      using a phone/IVR. The other aspect of automation comes into play, when
      you have to respond to your users, after receiving any submission.
      Acknowledging the response from your customers and showing them gratitude,
      for reaching out to you, is a small gesture that goes a long way. And you
      don't have to be on this job, 24/7. Web-form Auto-Responders, automate
      this process for you. Setting up an auto-responder helps you send out
      instant acknowledgment messages and keep your users, informed and engaged.
      Moreover, with form-builders like Formester, you get Auto-Responders that
      allow you to curate personalized acknowledgment messages/emails. 6.
      Platform Integrations You'd be delighted to know that web forms can be
      easily integrated with such platforms, using technologies such as Zapier
      integration. This includes integration with Google Sheets for data
      storage, Slack for communication, Salesforce, and many more. 7. Ease of
      Creation, Use and Accessibility With the no-code, drag-and-drop and
      intuitive interface, creating web forms becomes child's play. You don't
      need to have any coding expertise, for both creating a web form, as well
      as integrating it with your website. On the users' side, this
      materializes, as web forms that are easy to access and interesting to fill
      out. 8. Template Customizations Quality form builders, such as Formester,
      have a vast collection of pre-built, well-thought-out, customizable Form
      Templates. So if it's your first time developing a web form, or you're
      running at the eleventh hour, just pick a Template as per the type of form

      Website Should Feature 1. Contact Forms Contact forms are the most
      fundamental types of forms that your business's website should essentially
      feature. Apart from email ids, phone numbers, and physical addresses,
      contact forms are also a prime communication method, which you can offer
      your users. Contact forms can be used for a variety of reasons: Tracking
      and Resolving user inquiries Answering FAQs Gathering user submissions
      Offering customer service and support 2. Registration Forms Suppose you

      reward programs and schemes, that require your users to register
      themselves. In that case, registration forms are a must-have on your
      website. Your users can easily register themselves for any of the
      services, as mentioned above. Registration forms introduce time and
      resource-saving, central data storage and management, better customer
      support and service, event process automation, etc. 3. Payment Forms
      Payment forms are a gem for small businesses. Even if you don't have a

      elements result in greater response rates, thereby garnering more accurate
      and reliable user data, which can in turn be used for developing an
      emailing list and marketing strategies. 5. Feedback Forms Who doesn't want
      to showcase their quality of product and service and attract more and new
      customers! And this is best accomplished by Customer Testimonials,
      Feedbacks and Reviews. Not only do they display your product value, but
      also help showcase your credibility and build your brand presence.
      Therefore, having feedback forms and requesting your customers to fill
      them, is a great way to gain initial traction and build your brand. 6.
      Survey Forms Survey forms are a great way to gain data about several
      crucial factors, such as: Customer Satisfaction Brand Awareness Competitor
      Analysis Customer Experience and Expectation Product/Feature Development
