Enough of and about Academic Quizzes!

That's what we thought when we saw this meme:

![Funny meme showing students' reaction as soon as they hear the word "Quiz"!](/img/damn-here-we-go-again-.gif "Students' reaction as soon as they hear the word \"Quiz\"!")

The term [Quiz is so heavily coined in the Academic World](/blog/how-to-create-a-quiz-in-google-forms-the-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-need-in-2023-1/);

Upon encountering this meme, we couldn't help but relate to the **heavy association of the term Quiz with academic stress**. It seems to trigger memories of countless academic quizzes and evoke a not-so-happy feeling.

That said, today's blog is here to challenge this perception and introduce you to an exciting aspect of Online Quizzes – Entertainment Quizzes! 

But that's not all – we'll also explore how these lighthearted quizzes can generate leads, engage audiences, and boost your social media presence! 

## What are Entertainment Quizzes?

[Entertainment quizzes](/templates/categories/entertainment-quizzes/) are an interactive form of delightful quizzes that focus on fun and amusement. 

Unlike academic quizzes, they cover a range of diverse topics related to current trends, pop culture, movies, music, TV shows, and more. \
Designed to engage and entertain users, these quizzes offer a lighthearted experience, allowing participants to enjoy themselves while testing their knowledge and discovering intriguing insights about themselves.
