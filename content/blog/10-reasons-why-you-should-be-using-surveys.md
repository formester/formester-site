Here are 10 reasons why:


## 1. Taking valuable feedback from customers

Surveys are an incredible way to have your customers give you valuable feedback so that you can improve your products and services. They provide you with a large amount of data about the customers, their needs, and their overall experience with your products or services. 


## 2. Understand the requirements of your clientele 

There are plenty of reasons why you should start doing surveys on your product or service. They help you to develop a better understanding of your customers and their exact requirements. For me, this is an important thing because as a provider, I want to know what my clients expect from my products or my service offering.

## 3. Surveys help develop new products and improvise the older ones

If you've been told that surveys are just for market research then that is completely untrue. Many businesses use them to their advantage, by using surveys to help them develop new products or improve existing ones, as well as help direct their employees and customers. 


## 4. A quick way to know what’s trending in the market!

Surveys can be a terrific way to gather knowledge on what's trending out there in the market. You might have heard about surveys that are done by tech companies, or even marketing firms. With the huge amount of data available online, coming up with conclusions from those data would be a piece of cake.

## 5. They help in drafting a useful marketing strategy 

Surveys are an integral part of the marketing strategy. However, most companies tend to send surveys out willy-nilly without planning. If you've ever tried to implement a survey twist on your sales and marketing then you might already know this and I'm sure it must have worked out for you!


## 6. Asking the right questions in a survey

A good survey is built of questions that help your customer give an appropriate response as well as serve your purpose as an employer. It’s always significant to [ask the right questions](https://refiner.io/blog/product-survey-questions/) while conducting a survey, such as great design and smart technology. With well-designed surveys, you can easily ask a few questions that get you the desired results. 


## 7. Surveys are the first step towards starting a new business from scratch 

Surveys are the perfect first step to start any kind of new business as it assists you enormously with setting a base for your business and drafting a road map for future activities.


## 8. Target the right audience and make productive changes! 

Corporations need to ask their customers’ opinions. It's required by law, after all! But how do you know what to ask when you don't even know who your audience is? It is fruitful if you prepare a rough sketch of the target audience beforehand and then proceed with your survey research. The key is to interview both customers and non-customers. By combining these two groups, you'll get a fuller picture of what's going on.

## 9. It gives you a thorough review of your product/service 

If you can't put your finger on why customers aren't buying your product, do surveys. The results will surprise you. At times, the elephant in the room is right in front of our eyes but we concentrate on other things and miss out on the crucial or mainstream details.
