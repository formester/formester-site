* Short

Well, aren't all these a few qualities that would encourage you to fill out a web form?

As it is filling out a web form is a boring job;

![Funny meme showing how uninterested people are to fill out web forms](/img/top-5-web-forms-with-conditional-logic-to-integrate-with-your-website-in-2023.png "Would you rather complete a web form?")

And if your business wants to get this boring job done,

Today's blog discusses one such advanced web form feature, that inculcates all the aforementioned qualities, to bring forth an intelligent and response-oriented web form;

## Conditional Logic

Conditional logic, as the name itself suggests, operates on a given, if-then condition or statement.

In other words, it allows for dynamism, by executing a certain process or activity, only if a given prior established and defined, condition, rule or set of rules, is fulfilled first.

For example, Consider the following two statements:

1. It might rain today.
2. We won't go out.

Conditional Statement: If it rains today, then we won't go out.

![Infographic showing Conditional Logic Example: Consider the following two statements:  1. It might rain today; 2. We won't go out; Conditional Statement: If it rains today, then we won't go out.](/img/top-5-web-forms-with-conditional-logic-to-integrate-with-your-website-in-2023-1-.png "Conditional Logic Example")

It is clear that for the condition of not going out, to be met, the precondition of rain occurring, must first be met.
