Online forms are the go-to solution for a variety of your needs - from marketing surveys to lead generation, feedback collection and more. The ability to capture data is vital for organizations regardless of their
industry. The best thing about online forms is that they are decently easy to
create and scale. However, when it comes to choosing the best online form

given the wide array of options.

The core aim of online forms is to collect data and organize it efficiently, but the user experience is something you just cannot ignore in order to sustain a business. Amidst the intense competition, organizations need to be more consumer-centric than ever before.

It is always advisable to finalize your requirements first. Decide whether you need a standalone online form or want to integrate one into your website, the objective of the form, target audience and more depending on your deep requirements.

Now when it comes to choosing an online form builder, numerous aspects should be kept in mind including functionality, compatibility, design, customizability and pricing. So apart from a simple and easy solution to create online forms, you need to verify if a form builder would meet your needs. More features and customizations are good, but ideally, you should choose the one suiting all your requirements and with just enough features.

Let’s take a look at the best online form builders currently and find out how you can choose the ideal one for yourself.

More popularly known as a CRM tool, Hubspot also has a form builder which can be connected with the Hubspot CRM. Although a basic form builder, this solution allows creating forms with a drag and drop interface. Curating an online form as per dynamic requirements through conditional logic is possible with the tool.

Similar to other online form builders, Hubspot also can be used for creating a form with various question fields and creating embedded or standalone forms. The tool looks powerful if integrated with Hubspot’s CRM so that users can directly transmit the form data into the CRM. You can then leverage this data directly to run marketing campaigns.

**Pricing**: Free Basic Plan; $50/month for automation and marketing integration

### 3. Google Forms:

![Google forms landing page](/img/best-online-form-builder__googleform.png 'Google forms landing page')

A simple and quick form builder from Google, it is a free and efficient tool, especially for small applications. The forms can either be accessed through a link or embedded on a web page. It is a free tool and is good to begin with for users having immensely basic requirements.

However, Google Forms do not enable full customization, and there’s no option to configure the design. Users can, however, add images and videos to make it a bit more engaging. This form is particularly suited to quick and simple forms where just the questions matter, which is not most of the customer-facing forms.

**Pricing**: Free, one just needs a Google account

### 4. Paperform:

![Paperform landing page](/img/best-online-form-builder__paperform.png 'Paperform landing page')

Paperform makes online forms look like landing pages. Users can add photos, videos, headings and detailed long-form content to create a blog-like structure too. The tool is extensively used for creating product catalogues as it also allows users to take online payments. So an online form along with payments integration can be a handy combination for e-commerce and other online businesses.

**Pricing**: Basic plan starts at $240/year

### 5. Typeform:

![Typeform landing page](/img/best-online-form-builder__typeform.png 'Typeform landing page')

A conversational styled experience delivering tool, Typeform is a popular form builder and allows users to choose from various form design templates. Further, forms made using Typeform can have images, GIFs and videos too for enhanced engagement.

Typeform users would agree that it’s a design-oriented tool with maximum emphasis on making a form look amazing. Conditional logic and numerous integrations add up to its functionality.

The most talked about aspect of Typeform - one question at a time, is a nice feature to have. However, it might not go well with all types of form applications. For example – collecting critical and complex information should not be done that way because it needs double check and verification by users. It might end up confusing them.

**Pricing**: Starts at $29/month for single user

### 6. Jotform:

![Jotform landing page](/img/best-online-form-builder__jotform.png 'Jotform landing page')

One of the early online form building tools, Jotform offers a huge number of form templates for users. It enables users to heavily customize their forms based on the requirements. Numerous widgets can be used to create online forms from scratch. For those who love using templates - Jotform has a mix of both free and paid ones.

Apart from conventional features like conditional logic and form database, Jotform allows building PDF forms too. It’s a good platform for small business to get started, but the lack of proper guidance on using the tool makes it difficult for users. The free plan consists of very limited features which aren’t usually enough.

**Pricing**: The Bronze plan starts at $29/month

### 7. Formsite:

![Formsite landing page](/img/best-online-form-builder__formsite.png 'Formsite landing page')

The tool was launched in 1999, when people didn’t even know much about the existence of online forms. Formsite encrypts the data filled in online forms and that adds an extra layer of security. Specifically designed for critical information, users can also connect the forms to payment gateways like Stripe and Paypal. Some more useful features include linking multiple forms together and saving created blocks of form.

Formsite is an expensive solution as it allows a very limited number of forms to be made in its paid plans. Another peculiar aspect is the low bound on the number of responses. Even if the complexity of building forms and design aspects are kept aside, this tool is way too overpriced for the number of offerings.

**Pricing**: Starts at $24.95/month for 5 forms and 500 results per form.

## Which Online Form Builder Should You Choose?

The answer to this question is subjective to your requirements. Analyze if you’re looking for a free or paid solution, and what are your form requirements. For a very basic form with no specific design needs – you can go with Google Forms. And if you want to deliver a prolific user experience through your online forms, [Formester](/) can be your perfect destination. The plans at Formester start for free and it’s one of the most economical, yet comprehensive online form builders.
