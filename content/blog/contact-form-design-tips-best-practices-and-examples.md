A great website design has multiple elements, User Interface, User Experience, Image Quality, Technical Optimisation, FAQ Page, Services & Solutions Page, Case Studies, etc. There are multiple pages and elements you need to add to the website if you want to build a credible brand and topic authority. Another element that plays an important role is the Contact Form. ﻿

A [contact form](/blog/contact-forms-101-lead-generation-user-engagement-more/) lets your clients or website users provide you with invaluable feedback that can be used to improve your website. Moreover, the Contact Form helps you in lead generation so you can reach out to your potential audience. It does not matter what kind of website or business you own, you need a contact form on your website to connect with the users.﻿

In this blog, we will cover how to design contact forms strategically, covering everything from placement and design to personalised incentives and follow-up strategies. The blog offers valuable insights to help you transform your contact forms into powerful tools for driving conversions﻿

## 16 Design Tips to Create a Contact form for your Website﻿

### 1. Placement and Visibility﻿

Ensure that your contact forms are prominently placed on your website, preferably on key, high-traffic pages like the [homepage](https://formester.com/), [product or service pages](/features/), and [blog posts](https://formester.com/blog/). Make them easy to spot, so visitors don't have to search for them.﻿

### 2. Craft Compelling Copy﻿

Write clear and engaging copy for your contact form headings, instructions, and call-to-action buttons. [Highlight the value proposition of filling out the form](/blog/create-lead-capture-form-effectively/) – what benefits or solutions the user can expect by doing so﻿.

### 3. Segmentation and Personalisation﻿

Tailor your contact forms for different user segments or purposes. For instance, have separate forms for inquiries, demos, consultations, and downloads. This helps you collect specific data for targeted follow-ups﻿.

### 4. Offer Irresistible Incentives﻿

Provide valuable incentives such as e-books, whitepapers, webinars, free trials or exclusive discounts or content, in exchange for user contact information. Make sure the incentive aligns with their interests or pain points. This encourages users to submit the form and boosts lead capture.﻿

### 5﻿. Limit Fields

Keep the number of fields in your contact form concise. Asking for too much information upfront might deter users. Typically, asking for their name, email, and specific interest or pain point is sufficient. Conditional logic can be used to [display different questions based on user responses](/features/conditional-logic/). This ensures that users only see fields relevant to their needs, enhancing their experience and increasing the likelihood of completion.

### 6. Implement Social Proof﻿

Include trust-building elements like testimonials, client logos, or case study previews, which act as social proof elements near the form. Social proof instills confidence in users and encourages them to share their information.﻿

### 7. Automated Responses﻿

Set up [automated confirmation emails or thank-you messages](/features/auto-responder/) that users receive after submitting the form. This immediate response reassures them that their submission was successful.﻿

### 8﻿. Follow-Up Strategy

Develop a systematic follow-up strategy for the leads generated through contact forms. A quick response shows your commitment and increases the chances of conversion. Send personalized emails, provide additional resources, or address specific pain points. This nurtures leads through the sales funnel.

### 9. Integration with CRM and Marketing Tools﻿

[In](/integrations/)[tegrate your contact forms with a customer relationship management (CRM) system](/integrations/) and marketing automation tools. This helps you manage and track leads more efficiently, ensuring no opportunities slip through the cracks.﻿

### 1﻿0. A/B Testing

Experiment with different elements of your contact forms, such as copy, design, incentives, form length, and CTA text, to see what generates the best response rates. A/B testing helps identify which elements drive higher conversion rates and refine your lead generation strategy over time.﻿

### 11. Use Multi-Step Forms﻿

For longer forms, consider using multi-step forms. [Break down the information into smaller sections](/blog/single-page-vs-multi-page-forms/) to reduce user fatigue and increase completion rates.﻿

### 12. Use Progress Indicators﻿

If you have multi-step forms, add progress indicators to show users where they are in the process. This reduces abandonment rates by indicating the length of the form.﻿

### 1﻿3. Personalise Fields and CTAs

Personalize form fields and call-to-action (CTA) text to resonate with the user's intent. For instance, use "Get My Free E-Book" instead of a generic "Submit" button.﻿

### 14. Leverage Exit-Intent Popups﻿

Implement exit-intent popups with contact forms to capture leads from users who are about to leave your site. Offer a compelling reason to stay and engage with the form.﻿

### 1﻿5. Optimise Form Loading Speed

Ensure your forms load quickly. Slow-loading forms can deter users from completing the submission. Optimize images and scripts to maintain fast load times.﻿

### 16. Offer Chat Support﻿

Integrate a live chat option alongside your contact forms. Some users might prefer immediate interaction, and this can also serve as a lead capture tool.﻿

By implementing these strategies, you can turn your contact forms into powerful lead generation tools. Remember, the key is to provide value, personalise the experience, and make the process as smooth and engaging as possible for your users.﻿

And while lead generation is one of the key benefits of contact forms, there are several other benefits that accompany them.﻿

## Best Practices for High Converting Contact Forms﻿

Designing effective contact forms requires careful consideration to ensure user-friendliness, engagement, and conversion. Here are 10 tips to help you design contact forms that deliver results:

### 1. Keep it Simple﻿

Simplify your form by including only essential fields. Avoid overwhelming users with unnecessary information requests. The simpler the form, the higher the chances of completion.﻿

### 2. Prioritise Important Fields﻿

Place critical fields like name and email at the top. These are the most basic details you need to initiate communication with users.﻿

### 3﻿. Use Clear Labels and Instructions

Label each field clearly, and if needed, include instructions or examples. Users should understand the purpose of each field without confusion.﻿

### 4﻿. Utilise Smart Placeholder Text

Instead of standard "Name" or "Email" placeholders, provide context-sensitive examples like "John Doe" or "[yourname@example.com](mailto:yourname@example.com)."﻿

### 5. Group Related Fields﻿

Group related fields together using appropriate spacing or layout. For instance, group contact information fields together and separate them from the message or inquiry fields.﻿

### 6﻿. Implement Responsive Design

Ensure your form is responsive and functions well on various devices and screen sizes. A mobile-friendly design is crucial for user experience.﻿

### 7﻿. Optimise Button Design

Make your submit button stand out with contrasting colors and clear text (e.g., "Submit," "Send," "Get in Touch"). ﻿

### 8. Use Progressive Disclosure﻿

Consider using conditional logic to reveal additional fields only when necessary. This prevents overwhelming users with too many fields at once.﻿

### 9. Implement Real-time Validation﻿

Use real-time validation to show users errors as they fill out the form. This allows them to correct mistakes immediately instead of waiting until they hit submit.﻿

### 10. Whitespace & Visual Feedback﻿

Use ample whitespace to create a clean and organised form layout. Proper spacing between fields and sections enhances readability and user experience. Display visual feedback when users interact with the form, such as highlighting the selected field or showing a checkmark after successful submission.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid with Contact Forms ﻿

Here are some common mistakes to avoid when creating and using contact forms:﻿

**1) Asking for Too Much Information**﻿ - One of the most common mistakes is asking for excessive information in the form. Long forms can be overwhelming for users, leading to form abandonment. Stick to the essentials like name, email, and relevant details to avoid deterring users.﻿

**2) Not Providing Clear Instructions** ﻿- Unclear instructions can confuse users, leading to errors or incomplete submissions. Make sure your form has clear labels, placeholders, and guidance for each field to ensure users understand what's expected.﻿

**3﻿) Lack of Device-Optimization** - If your contact form isn't optimized for various devices and screen sizes, you risk alienating mobile users. Ensure your form is responsive and functions well on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.﻿

**4) Missing or Unclear Call-to-Action** ﻿- A strong call-to-action (CTA) button is essential to encourage users to submit the form. Ensure your CTA is prominent, well-designed, and clearly indicates what will happen when clicked (e.g., "Submit," "Request Callback," etc.).﻿

**5) No Privacy Assurance**﻿ - Failing to include a privacy assurance can make users hesitant to share their information. Add a brief note about data protection and how their information will be used, following best practices like GDPR compliance.﻿

**6) Ignoring User Experience (UX)** -﻿ Poorly designed forms with confusing layouts, too many steps, or distracting elements can frustrate users. Focus on providing a smooth and intuitive user experience to encourage completion.﻿

**7) Not Testing the Form**﻿ - Neglecting to test the form thoroughly before making it live can lead to technical glitches or user experience issues. Test the form's functionality, responsiveness, and appearance across different devices.﻿

**8﻿) No Validation and Error Messages** - Lack of proper validation (e.g., for email addresses) and informative error messages can frustrate users when they make mistakes. Offer real-time validation and clear error messages to guide users towards correct submissions.﻿

**9﻿. No Confirmation or Thank-You Page** - After submitting a form, users should receive confirmation that their submission was successful. A thank-you page or confirmation message assures users that their information was received.﻿

**1﻿0) Ignoring Analytics and Data** - Not analysing form data and responses can prevent you from understanding user behavior and making necessary improvements. Regularly review analytics to identify trends and areas for optimization.﻿

**11) Overcomplicating with Captchas**﻿ - While captchas are useful to prevent spam, overly complex captchas can frustrate users. Choose user-friendly options or consider alternatives like honeypot fields to deter spammers.﻿

**12) Ignoring Integration Opportunities**﻿ - If your contact form integrates with other tools (e.g., CRM, email marketing), ignoring these opportunities can lead to missed chances for lead nurturing and customer relationship management.

Now let's explore a few real-world examples, where big brands from various industries smartly employed contact forms to achieve different business objectives. ﻿
