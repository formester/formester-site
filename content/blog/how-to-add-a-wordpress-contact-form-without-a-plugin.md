In today's era, having a successful business isn't just about having an excellent product or service to offer, infact, it's more about how you reach your audience with what you have to offer.

According to a research by [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying) - **personalization drives 10% to 15% increase in revenue (with company-specific lift spanning 5 to 25 percent, driven by sector and ability to execute)**.
