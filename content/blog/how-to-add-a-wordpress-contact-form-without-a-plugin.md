In today's era, having a successful business isn't just about having an excellent product or service to offer, infact, it's more about how you reach your audience with what you have to offer.

According to a research by [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying) - **personalization drives 10% to 15% increase in revenue (with company-specific lift spanning 5 to 25 percent, driven by sector and ability to execute)**. 

The more access you have to your clients, the greater the scope of personalization you can offer in your communication & services. 

Knowing this, how often have you wondered about having a sophisticated yet simple solution that helps you reach your clients? 

Besides reaching out to your clients, have you ever considered, if your clients also have an easy, neat and efficient means to reach you whenever they wish to do so?

If yes, then chances are you are aware of the existence & importance of [contact forms](https://fluentforms.com/why-you-need-contact-form/).

![Contact Forms are more common than you think!](/img/no-one-users-whenever-they-encounter-a-contact-form.png "Contact Forms are more common than you think!")

Contact forms are an elegant and advanced means of establishing a meaningful connection with your clients. 

Whilst from a user perspective, a contact form is an easy way to reach out to a business with any queries or inquiries they have as regards a  product or service.

On the business side, these forms can prove to be a dominant feature that allow for the gathering of key client information such as name, email address, contact number, purpose of contact, et., which helps businesses  to create a digital paper trail and provides scope for potential marketing as well.

## WordPress, Websites & Contact Forms 

WordPress is a content management system (CMS), written in hypertext preprocessor language and paired with a MySQL database, designed to build and host websites. 

Its simple, easy-to-use, articulate and coherent build makes it a popular choice for website designers and businesses. 

According to statistics available on [Colorlib](https://colorlib.com/wp/wordpress-statistics/)- **810 million websites use WordPress, which is 43% of all the websites on the internet.**

![A pie-chart showing market share of WordPress in the e-commerce website industry which stands at 43%. It also shows that WooCommerce has 30% while, Shopify has 18% ownership. The remaining 9% is attributed to other sources.](/img/pie-chart.png "WordPress Market Share in E-Commerce")

If you've read this far, we believe you already have a WordPress website but aren't sure about your contact forms integrating with it;

If not, [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/?aff=15767&cid=1654213), here's a shoutout: Build a clean and smooth website with WordPress; 

& integrate it with a no code, [drag-and-drop and easy to make Contact Form](https://formester.com/templates/categories/contact-forms/) using Formester!

Although, contact forms can be integrated with your WordPress website by using or not using a plug-in; working with [plug-ins](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/plugin.htm) isn't always a fun game. 

For certain features, such as the one under discussion, the usage of plug-ins can result in: 

* management complexity, 
* slowed website performance, 
* and even put your website at risk of security threats such as data theft, malware and viruses.

  Besides, there are quite a few awesome form-builders (such as [Formester](https://formester.com/)), who cater to the businesses' specific customization and design requirements.

  Having said this, let's discuss how to…

Next, you'll have a unique form embed code for your newly created form. Copy this embed code.

> Design Tip: Make sure the form that you create is consistent with regard to your branding and messaging theme. Don't forget to add your logo as well! 
>
> Also ensure that you only use a limited number of form fields and ask for only relevant information that  revolve around your target for submission. 
>
> These small tweaks go a long way in helping you gain more submissions. 

### Step 3 - Add your Form to a WordPress Page

From your WordPress dashboard, click **Pages** and select **Add New**.
Give the page a befitting title.

### Step 4 - Final Setup

Add an HTML block to your page.

In the **Add HTML** section, under the Title field, paste the embed code you copied in Step 3. 

![Paste the copied embed code in the **Add HTML** section on the new page you added in step 3](/img/wp-img-2.png "Paste the embed code in the **Add HTML** section")

## The Top 5 Reasons you should have Contact Forms on your website

(before you go)

![Top 5 Reasons you should have Contact Forms on your website](/img/use-as-needed.png "Top 5 Reasons you should have Contact Forms on your website")

### 1. User-Centric

Contact forms are simple and easy to use. If more comfortable doing so, your customers can write to you rather than talk. 

They also get the opportunity to explain their details and queries more elaborately. 

### 2. Marketing, Advertising & Promotion

Once you have the contact details of your audience, you can open the doors to personalized marketing in the form of newsletters, events, promotional offers and the list goes on!

### 3. Spam-Proofing

Providing email addresses and phone numbers for business communications, has a high chance of bringing in spam emails, calls and other junk with itself. 

Contact Forms, on the other hand, can be set-up for preventing and blocking spam bots from entering your lists. 

### 4. Coherent Information Sources

Contact Forms provide your clients with the opportunity to illustrate their details, queries, problems and reasons for contact, in a much more crisp, to-the-point and specific (yet elaborative when required) fashion. 

### 5. Resource Saving

By employing contact forms, your business saves time, energy and money spent on manual labor for queries that can be resolved using auto-responders, spam prevention and protection and providing intelligent and efficient responses to customers. 

All this in turn, leads to improved resource utilization and establishment of better customer relationships as well!

## C﻿onclusion

C﻿ontact forms are an elegant and sophisticated means of acquiring key information from your clients.\
A﻿t the same time, they also help in establishing more meaningful connections with your clients.

A﻿ fair share of the website e-commerce industry, is held by WordPress.

Brand customized and tailored contact forms can be added to WordPress websites even without the usage of plug-ins;

and to reiterate, these contact forms bring plenty of advantages to your business!
