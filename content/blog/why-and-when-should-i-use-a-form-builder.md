      2. Enable customization: Curate your form the way you want in terms of structure, type of form fields, data to be collected, design, graphics, submission button redirection, fonts, colors – whatever it takes to appeal to the respondents and accomplish the form’s objective.

      3. Enable you to gather accurate data: The most crucial benefit of using online form-building tools is the accuracy and efficiency of collecting the data. Not only is it super-easy for you to accumulate data from your audience, but you also get it in an organized way, making your job even simpler.

      4. Allow easy sharing: Whether you are sharing your form as a standalone form or embedding it to your website – sharing with your audience is a matter of just a single click.

      5. Help you personalize user experience: Using features like conditional logic, you can create forms that personalize the user experience based on the user inputs. This significantly improves the end-user experience and hence boosts the response rate."
