      \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Essential Elements of A Brand Survey: 1. Crafting
      a Brand Kit A Brand Kit, aka Brand Identity Kit, is a company asset that
      consists of design themes, graphics, iconography, and other messaging
      keynotes pertaining to the company's branding ideology. It is a
      representation of the company's ideology and essence. It comprises of the
      following: a) Company's Logo: Strategic logo design and placement over all
      products, services, content, and contributions. b) Design Theme: Colour
      scheme, palette, typeface and theme for websites, products, apps and more.
      c) Messaging and Expression: Usage of consistent messaging theme,
      following associated terminology and maintaining brand expression. d)
      Identity Representatives: Genuine URL with the correct domain and
      authentic contact mediums, such as email addresses, forms, phone numbers,
      etc. Once you have a brand kit ready, you should consider developing all
      other entities, including your survey form, according to it. 2. Asking the
      Right and Relevant Questions Choosing to ask the right questions can make
      or break your survey results. Consider adhering strictly to questions
      about your brand, both as an individual entity and in comparison to your
      competitors. It's also good to ask questions that give you a hint about
      your industry standards and how far you match them. However, the most
      crucial set of questions that you should take advantage of, are those that
      help you judge your appeal amongst your customers, their perceptions and
      ideas of your brand, and their likes and dislikes about the same. To
      increase your affability, be sure you give thanks to your survey
      responders! Set-up an Auto-Responder, to send out a quick thanks for
      taking their valuable time to fill up your survey. 3. Providing a safe,
      smooth and effortless platform Ensure your survey is published on
      transparent platforms whilst maintaining the safety and security standards
      for your users. Don't have them go through complex, frustrating and
      time-consuming spam-protection tests; To get the most out of your
      submissions, provide them with a smooth, intuitive, and spam-proof
      interface. Ultimately, a survey is also a representation of your brand! 4.
      Analytics System A survey becomes ineffectual if you simply use it to
      collect submissions. It is essential to be able to consolidate your
      submissions into data and eventually analyze that data to gather valuable
      insights into your key metrics and performance indicators. The insights
      obtained should be powerful enough to guide you toward making calculated,
      critical and informed decisions about your products, services and
      marketing strategies. Having a dynamic form builder that allows you to
      both devise an effective survey and analyze its submissions is, therefore,
      crucial. Bonus Tip: As a gesture of appreciation, you may include rewards

      like discount coupons, reward points for future purchases, event invites,
      etc., suffice the intent. 5. Taking the Leap Once you have gained insights
      into customer mindsets, behaviors and perceptions as regards your brand;
      Be bold and make changes according to those insights. Ofcourse, take
      calculated risks. But take actions to tweak your product and marketing
      strategies, accordingly. Strike a balance between your ideas and your
