As the era of technology, AI and digitization advances to make powerful impacts in almost every field of the Business World;

Even the exceptionally people-oriented field of Sales and Marketing, fails to remain untouched.

From tailored messaging, driving A/B Testing at scale, and generating images for advertising, to even copywriting,

[AI is capable of doing it](https://blog.socialmediastrategiessummit.com/10-examples-of-ai-in-marketing/)!

However, as Jeffrey Gitomer has said - 

Great salespeople are relationship builders who provide value and help their customers win.

And fortunately enough for sales professionals and marketers, the one thing that [AI, or any other technology for that matter, can never replace](https://bigthink.com/the-future/what-ai-cannot-do/), is the impact, value and importance offered by human connection and interactions.

Indeed, the very core requirements of the domain of sales and marketing will always remain exceptional presentation and delivery of the product, which demands the need for talented, confident and enthusiastic sales professionals and marketers, who are able to effectively communicate the ideology behind the product.

That said, it is safe to say that the age-old marketing strategies of door-to-door selling and closing sales in-person, are here to remain.

However, that doesn't have to necessarily mean that the sales and marketing industry has to remain alienated from such technological advancements;

In fact, digitization and AI, are the tools that are capable of taking any business to a whole new level, simply by introducing features like automation, tracking and monitoring, and virtualization to the various sets of business processes, thereby improving the overall efficiency and functioning of the business.
