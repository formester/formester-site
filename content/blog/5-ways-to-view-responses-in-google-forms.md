You’ve created a Google Form, shared it with participants, and now you are eagerly awaiting their responses. But how exactly do you check these incoming responses on Google Forms?

Managing responses in Google Forms helps you make the most of the data you’ve collected. It assists in understanding the feedback, insights, and information provided by your respondents.

In this article, we’ll walk you through five simple methods for reviewing the responses you’ve received. These techniques will help you check the responses conveniently and gain valuable insights from your Google Form submissions.

Let’s have a look at 5 ways you can view responses in Google Forms:

## 1) Summary Tab

The “Summary” tab in Google Forms is a powerful tool for visualising response data. It provides an overview of your responses in a structured and easy-to-understand format.

To create and customise a summary of responses, follow these steps:

1. Access your Google Form.
2. Click on the “Responses” tab.
3. Select the “Summary” option.
4. Optionally, include different types of charts and graphs to enhance the visual appeal and clarity of your data.

The “Summary” tab offers several benefits. It allows you to quickly grasp the key trends and patterns within your responses. This visual representation simplifies the process of analysing the data, making it easier to identify important insights at a glance.

## 2) Question Tab

The “Question” tab in Google Forms enables you to access the responses on a question-by-question basis. This method is particularly useful when you want to dive deeper into the collected responses for specific questions within your form.

To check responses using the “Question” tab, follow these steps:

1. Access your Google Form.
2. Click on the “Responses” tab.
3. Select the “Individual” option.
4. Choose a specific question from the list.
5. You’ll see a breakdown of responses related to that particular question, providing insights into how participants answered it.

This method is highly beneficial for in-depth analysis. It allows you to focus on individual questions, helping you understand how respondents are engaging with specific parts of your form. This can be invaluable for making targeted improvements or refining your questions to gather more accurate and relevant data.

## 3) Individual Tab

The “Individual” tab in Google Forms provides a detailed view of each respondent’s feedback. It allows you to review and analyse responses on an individual respondent basis.

To view responses using the “Individual” tab, follow these steps:

1. Access your Google Form.
2. Click on the “Responses” tab.
3. Choose the “Individual” option.
4. You’ll see a list of individual respondents, each with their respective answers to the questions in your form.

This method is especially useful for understanding the feedback provided by each participant individually. It allows you to assess their specific responses, making it ideal for personalised follow-ups or addressing unique concerns. Whether you’re conducting surveys, quizzes, or feedback forms, the “Individual” tab helps you gain valuable insights into each respondent’s perspective.

## 4) Google Sheet

Another method to manage and analyse responses in Google Forms is by exporting them to a Google Sheets document. This process allows you to work with the data in a more versatile and detailed way.

To export responses to a Google Sheets document, you can follow these steps:

1. Access your Google Form.
2. Click on the “Responses” tab.
3. In the upper right corner, you’ll find a Google Sheets icon. Click on it to create a linked spreadsheet.
4. All the responses from your form will be automatically transferred to the Google Sheets document for further analysis and organisation.

Using Google Sheets for your responses allows you to perform more comprehensive data analysis, including sorting, filtering, and creating custom charts and graphs. Additionally, you can collaborate with others on the spreadsheet, making it a powerful tool for team analysis and data-driven decision-making.

## 5) CSV File

You can also export all your form responses as a CSV file for offline analysis. This method allows you to work with your data without an internet connection.

To download all your form responses as a CSV file, follow these steps:

1. Access your Google Form.
2. Click on the “Responses” tab.
3. In the upper right corner, you’ll find a three-dot menu icon. Click on it.
4. Choose the “Download responses (.csv)” option.
5. The CSV file will be downloaded to your device, ready for offline analysis using spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

The use of CSV files offers flexibility and portability in response management. You can store and work with your data offline, making it accessible at any time. Moreover, CSV files are compatible with various software and applications, making it easy to import your data into different tools for more advanced analysis or integration with other systems. This method is particularly useful when you need to keep a copy of your data or perform in-depth analysis beyond what Google Forms provides.
