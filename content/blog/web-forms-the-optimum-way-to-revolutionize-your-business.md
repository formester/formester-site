**In today’s era of technology, digitization & the internet, rapid & immense industrial growth is no longer a distant dream for businesses. With the emergence of more & more, unique *AI driven solutions*, like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex), etc., we are at the threshold of a disruption to the conventional & long-established business styles.**

Does that mean [mass lay-offs](https://news.crunchbase.com/startups/tech-layoffs/)? Well, that’s a different subject of discussion.

![The layoff wave has swept not only startups and mid-sized firms, but also big tech companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google parent Alphabet, among others](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/k70_WnaD_juBpNqPHaLPFuiNasBkrVxHkr8AN-RU2edV3IbTKPaIOu8-9PSGUO_VaL5U0i3bX9A09eZ4kiCxyXGoe8tczw4RgoO3HzNNw0ohg9JC2rS4YJOXK3m3Cstj0wbVOJsXYJ2fLjUCJ4d-Efo "Michael Scott fires")

**But, does that mean businesses can *expect newer & more efficient ways* to *operate and optimize their processes*?**

Yes! And that’s what [digital transformation](https://enterprisersproject.com/what-is-digital-transformation) is all about. And today we are going to discuss one of the most important elements of digital transformation: **WEB FORMS**.

# What is a WEB FORM?

![How Web Forms Can Help Your Website Generate Leads - Proof Branding](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/v2XsjwbRh9ayqrPp2MD816IJoHNIl6kmAtZtD49Z4W1-Q7GfkPvp2NKxlPAQZ4zba0VkjbifR7Aqj1aWmV6H11UswOU5OmPr71nGlO5Ts09dFZQ78sn1gPKqzNtKBkkQtcFw6pB8DEZOGCrwcnD44Yo "Web Form - Basics")

A **Web Form**, or an [HTML Form](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-forms/) (as the tech nerds you know like to call it) is an online page/document which allows the website on which they are hosted, to gather data/input/personal information from its users and subsequently transfer it to a server for processing.

Web Forms can be of several kinds depending upon the information the business is required to obtain from its users.

![Most Important Types of Web Forms ](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/E3VEyY9f6dafVAbK28JkQq2dWjcrVumRLEq3y7E-diXWA0M6nUXLiQVd8yW8CCZwFhmnf216IAK06XUhTlVX18ZsOzDcuzyz_-AIKImOChpVgLLcyOmWo5qA_mHhwHeF7kqtsHI1QPKcDNasmncUfKk "Types of Web Forms ")

Although there is no limitation or a defined scope as regards the appearance, length, content-type, format, layout, design, etc., of a form, it should fundamentally be user-centric; as in understandable by the user, possessing only relevant fields, simple with a glitch-free and smooth interface.

IMPACT OF WEB FORMS ON BUSINESSES

Web Forms, as the name itself suggests, are web based and so are the data storage & analysis systems associated with them. Not only do they make obtaining the information easy, but also help in storing & analysing it in a more organized and efficient manner.

Quoting [HubSpot’s 2022 marketing statistics](https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics) – ***“28% of marketers say the right form fields help improve lead scoring, which means more qualified leads.”***

![109 Online Form Abandonment Statistics: 2023 Data, Trends & Impact -  Financesonline.com](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JadVbn8wYq0o0SOsAwScqcmOfaN__ePQoTRjzAYxpnIhNJ9JXXzIStTUbO2ccUGKiPx8mSt7caC_8eDqNp9PlyFauUXghsltq8GGBTVaOkjuAFCSgGiETwBu_ed_rtVOSbWrCV2SehH3AxFFlQnmxOc "Conversion Rates as a result of Using Forms")

They are a paper-free and economic solution for gathering, storing and analysing user/client data making them sustainable both for the economy & the ecology. (Well, kind of a threat to Dunder-Mifflin!)

![Dunder Mifflin Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Dunder_Mifflin%2C_Inc.svg "A Paper Company faces threat because of Web Forms")



Since it’s all web based, **tracking and accessing any updates and change**s becomes **real-time** and **synchronized**. Not only does **capturing information become easy**, but so does **validating**, **authenticating** and **integrating** it with the **crucial business systems**. The business processes, in general become streamlined and lead to **improved & accelerated customer service & satisfaction**, **feasible operational costs and reduced cycle times,** mutually benefiting the business and its client.

As the information entered by the user directly gets stored on the server, the **errors** caused due to manual data entry and its associated transmission, become almost **negligible**. ***The information obtained therefore, is based on accurate and reliable analysis and can be used for making well-informed and largely unambiguous business decisions.***

With [CMS & SAP systems](https://sapinsider.org/topic/sap-application-development-integration/sap-cms/) in place, submitted forms find **secured storage, sharing & management**.

Needless to say, they **save the time, effort and resources of the organization**.

But the real deal is, 

WHY SHOULD YOUR BUSINESS USE FORMS? 

![Create a Database-Driven Online Form Builder | Caspio](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Jwj1wKP6U70s9XaZHHq02QNWkOW-CUH-IaBlQeCT7cHSDV1mmrliKthrRjib7Y-tZbUOAr-JQgGuO8J2CYRl1Xfh8tzyDsAtxaCFRWBJmuH2rCb8N0xpD_CQxRq_VrNHRGoB-EKt-qg1Ur_To1-7zVg)

Well, the thing about ‘tech’ is, it sort of expands to all areas. Whether you’re a tech company offering [SaaS, IaaS, PaaS solutions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-iaas-paas-and-saas/); a clothing/fashion brand looking to expand through their website; a restaurant; or even an education-service based company; it doesn’t matter. ***If you have a website & are looking to expand, web forms will cater to you!***

A few ways on how forms can help your business are discussed below:

**1. ACQUIRING LEADS:** The most important functionality of web-forms is undoubtedly, **acquiring leads**. If you set up a [contact form](https://formester.com/templates/) and ask your potential clients for their emails, you can easily create an extensive **emailing-list**. Adding a checkbox asking your users to subscribe to your **monetized newsletter** or even for simply allowing that they receive your **promotional offers**, can go a long way with regard to both **traffic** to your website as well as [brand-building](https://freshsparks.com/successful-brand-building-process/).

**2. GATHERING FEEDBACK:** The most important thing after acquiring a customer, is to get them to give you feedback. They can be used in the form of **testimonials** and can be helpful for **showcasing your performance**. Also, worthwhile feedback from even a small percentage of your customer base, might just end up giving you the breakthrough you were seeking for your product. Besides, it helps you to **connect better with your customers** and they feel a better sense of connection with your brand. **Value the customers & they value your brand!**

**3. ONLINE RETAILING:** People who don’t want to bear the expenses incurred by an e-commerce website may start selling products and services online using a form tool which allows for [payment integrations](https://formester.com/integrations/).![The Impact of Online Retailing on Commercial Property](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TwnMEGl7EypzSD9ZJsSPzkwT-KXkydJwMFSDkAlAtz6ILrM0drcs0xK-fQt8Sz5lZjweCQFcnX9yQf-DGW5z6cbEbTtxtjZBaTayYj7QNl-kyAZPMFBqwkQiFbPyl7P9St8WdCyzWE14SJ9rE4lCpww)

**4. LINK-BUILDING & WEBSITE TRAFFIC:**  Forms are a viable method to **gain valuable input** from your users, in the manner of **images, feedback, reviews, comments & even entire blog posts**. The responses thus received, may act as [traffic sources](https://seodesignchicago.com/marketing/what-is-a-traffic-source/) and help in [back-linking](https://moz.com/learn/seo/backlinks) as well. All this, and the users don’t even have to have access to the backend of your website.

**5. EVENT/SEMINAR/WEBINAR BASED FORMS:** In case **event, seminar & webinar sign-ups** are a large part of your product/service growth, forms again have a vital role to play. For instance, businesses that depend on generating funding through websites like [KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) & [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/), often require a large emailing/contact list for promotions/deals/advertisements and forms are a sophisticated way to build this list.

**6. SURVEYS:** Gone are the days, where surveys were conducted by going door-to-door. Surveys are now-a-days not only conducted for government/official/institutional purposes but also serve as a resource for case-studies, researches and large-scale studies. Large websites like [HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/surveys), [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/), etc. often have **annual blogs showcasing statistics for various topics**. These statistics are indeed obtained through survey forms & their analysis. This also improves the **user engagement** on the website.
