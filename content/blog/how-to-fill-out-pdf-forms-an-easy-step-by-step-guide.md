      1. Maintaining Document Integrity

      PDF forms preserve the integrity of the original document, ensuring that the layout, formatting, and structure remain intact. This integrity is crucial when submitting professional or legal documents, as it ensures that the information is presented as intended and prevents unauthorized modifications.


      2. Maintaining Consistency

      When it comes to PDF Forms, users only have the permission to fill out the specific form fields with the required information, ensuring consistency and accuracy across multiple submissions.


      3. Digital Signatures and Security

      PDF forms support the integration of digital signatures, adding an extra layer of security and authenticity to the document. Digital signatures provide assurance that the form has not been tampered with and that the information submitted is reliable. PDF forms also offer encryption options, allowing sensitive data to be protected and shared securely.


      4. Accessibility and Compatibility

      PDF forms are highly accessible as they can be opened and filled out on various devices and operating systems. PDF files can be viewed and edited on computers, tablets, and smartphones using a wide range of software applications. This compatibility ensures that users can access and interact with PDF forms without any significant limitations.


      5. Legal and Compliance Requirements

      PDF forms provide a standardized format that is widely accepted and recognized, ensuring conformity to legal and regulatory requirements.


      6. Remote Collaboration

      Since forms can be shared electronically via email or cloud storage platforms, stakeholders can fill out the form simultaneously or sequentially. This collaborative aspect enhances productivity and expedites the completion of tasks.


      7. Archiving and Document Preservation

      As PDF files can be easily archived and stored digitally, they ensure that the information remains accessible and retrievable for future reference, thus making them the ideal choice for long-term document preservation. 


      8. Cost and Environmental Benefits

      Using PDF forms eliminates the need for printing and distributing paper forms, resulting in cost savings and reduced environmental impact. By going digital, organizations can save on printing expenses, reduce paper waste, and contribute to sustainability efforts."

            "text": "Method 1: Using A Third-party PDF Reader/Editor - Adobe Acrobat
      To fill out PDF forms, you'll need a PDF reader or editor. 

      Step 1: Obtaining & Opening the PDF Form

      PDF forms are shared through various sources such as email attachments, links, websites, or document-sharing platforms. 


      You may either save the PDF form by downloading it on your device or directly open it in the PDF Reader/Editor.


      Select the PDF Form you want to fill out, and right-click on the same.

      Now click on the Open with button and from the drop-down select Adobe Acrobat Reader.

      Step 2: Fill out your Form

      Once you've opened your PDF form in the Adobe Acrobat Reader, from the right pane, select the Fill & Sign tool.

      Now considering that the form has been made fillable, or editable for specific, required fields, you'll be able to click into such fields and enter your information.

      Step 3: Signing your form

      If your form requires you to add your signature, from the toolbar, click Sign. 


      Users then have the option to draw, type, or choose an image for their signature. 

      Next, click Apply to place your signature on the form.


      Step 4: Verify and Review Your Responses:

      Once you've filled out all the required fields, you may review your responses for accuracy and the overall form for completeness.

      Double-check spellings, dates, and any other relevant information to ensure it matches your intentions. 


      Step 5: Save and Secure Your Completed Form

      After reviewing your responses, save the completed form to your device.


      It's wise to rename the file to reflect its content and to prevent any confusion later.

      Additionally, if the form contains sensitive information, consider encrypting or password-protecting the PDF to ensure its security.


      Step 6: Submitting or Sharing the Form

      After you have filled out the form, depending on the purpose of the form, you may need to submit or share it with others. 


      If the form is meant to be electronically submitted, follow the specific instructions provided, such as attaching the PDF to an email or uploading it to a designated website.


      Method 2: Converting PDF to Word & then again to PDF

      Now whilst this method is free and pretty straightforward, it doesn't come without a few limitations.


      Step 1: Open the PDF Form with Word

      Right-click on the PDF form you want to edit, then click Open with.


      From the drop-down menu, if Word (MS-Word) is directly available, select it. 


      If not, click Choose another app.


      Under the More Options section, scroll until you see Word, and then click OK.  


      Now, you'll see a dialog box that asks permission to convert the PDF to Word. Click OK;


      And Word will now automatically start converting your PDF to a Word Document.


      Step 2: Editing the Form

      Once you've obtained the PDF in a Word format, you may edit and fill out the fields as required.


      Step 3: Export as PDF

      Once you've added and edited your required details, click on File > Export > Create PDF/XPS.


      Select the location in your device, where you want the exported/published PDF to be saved.


      Also, give the document a suitable name.


      And, that's it, your PDF form is ready for sharing and submissions!


      There are several software options available, both free and paid, that allow users to fill out PDF forms.


      Some of the popular choices include:


      Adobe Acrobat Reader DC

      Foxit Reader 

      Nitro PDF Reader"

## What is a PDF Form?

A PDF form is a type of online and/or digital document that exists in a PDF Format and contains interactive form fields where users can edit, enter and provide their information.

Essentially, the format is used when you need to save files that cannot be modified but still need to be easily shared and printed.  Today most devices have a version of Adobe Reader or can open a PDF in an Internet Browser. 

However, PDF forms are often used for surveys, applications, contracts, and other types of documents that require user interaction. PDF forms can be filled out digitally using specific software.

## How to Fill Out A PDF Form?

Now, when it comes to filling out PDF forms, there are 2 ways to do so.

### Method 1: Using A Third-party PDF Reader/Editor - Adobe Acrobat

To fill out PDF forms, you'll need a PDF reader or editor. 

There are several software options available, both free and paid, that allow users to fill out PDF forms.

Some of the popular choices include:

* [Adobe Acrobat Reader DC](https://get.adobe.com/reader/)
* [Foxit Reader](https://www.foxit.com/pdf-reader/) 
* [Nitro PDF Reader](https://www.gonitro.com/)

While choosing a PDF Reader/Editor, it is essential to analyze your requirements (such as the frequency of forms and attempts); and then select the one that best suits your needs.

While this tutorial is based on using Adobe Acrobat, it is noteworthy that most PDF readers have a straightforward interface that allows users to navigate through their functionalities and edit or fill out specific form fields as required.

#### Step 1: Obtaining & Opening the PDF Form

PDF forms are shared through various sources such as email attachments, links, websites, or document-sharing platforms. 

You may either save the PDF form by downloading it on your device or directly open it in the PDF Reader/Editor.

Select the PDF Form you want to fill out, and **right-click** on the same.

Once you've opened your PDF form in the Adobe Acrobat Reader, from the **right pane**, select the **Fill & Sign** tool.

![Screenshot showing: The right pane > Fill & Sign tool](/img/how-to-fill-out-pdf-forms_-an-easy-step-by-step-guide-5-.png "The right pane > Fill & Sign tool")

Now considering that the form has been made fillable, or editable for specific, required fields, you'll be able to click into such fields and enter your information.

![Screenshot showing: Form edits being made by a user](/img/how-to-fill-out-pdf-forms_-an-easy-step-by-step-guide-6-.png "Form edits being made by a user")

Users can also **add checkmarks** and **fill in radio buttons**.

> **Tip:** With Adobe, you have the option to fill your form by not only clicking a text field and typing your information, but also by **adding a text box**. 

#### Step 3: Signing your form

If your form requires you to add your signature, from the **toolbar**, click **Sign**. 

Users then have the option to **draw**, **type**, or **choose an image** for their signature. 

![Screenshot showing: Signature Insertion](/img/how-to-fill-out-pdf-forms_-an-easy-step-by-step-guide-7-.png "Signature Insertion")

Next, click **Apply** to place your signature on the form.

#### Step 4: Verify and Review Your Responses:

Once you've filled out all the required fields, you may review your responses for accuracy and the overall form for completeness. \
Double-check spellings, dates, and any other relevant information to ensure it matches your intentions. 

#### Step 5: Save and Secure Your Completed Form

After reviewing your responses, save the completed form to your device. 

It's wise to rename the file to reflect its content and to prevent any confusion later. \
Additionally, if the form contains sensitive information, consider encrypting or password-protecting the PDF to ensure its security.

#### Step 6: Submitting or Sharing the Form

After you have filled out the form, depending on the purpose of the form, you may need to submit or share it with others. 

If the form is meant to be electronically submitted, follow the specific instructions provided, such as attaching the PDF to an email or uploading it to a designated website.

### Method 2: Converting PDF to Word & then again to PDF

#### Step 1: Open the PDF Form with Word

**Right-click** on the PDF form you want to edit, then click **Open with**.

From the drop-down menu, if **Word** (MS-Word) is directly available, select it. 

If not, click **Choose another app**.

![Screenshot showing: Right click > Choose another app](/img/how-to-fill-out-pdf-forms_-an-easy-step-by-step-guide-8-.png "Right click > Choose another app")

Under the **More Options** section, scroll until you see Word, and then click OK.  

![Screenshot showing: More Options > Word > OK](/img/how-to-fill-out-pdf-forms_-an-easy-step-by-step-guide-9-.png "More Options > Word > OK")

And Word will now automatically start converting your PDF to a Word Document.

#### Step 2: Editing the Form

Once you've obtained the PDF in a Word format, you may edit and fill out the fields as required.

![Screenshot showing: The PDF Form in a Word format](/img/how-to-fill-out-pdf-forms_-an-easy-step-by-step-guide-11-.png "The PDF Form in a Word format")

![Screenshot showing: File > Export > Create PDF/XPS](/img/how-to-fill-out-pdf-forms_-an-easy-step-by-step-guide-12-.png "File > Export > Create PDF/XPS")

Select the location in your device, where you want the exported/published PDF to be saved.

Also, give the document a suitable name.

And, that's it, your PDF form is ready for sharing and submissions!

![Screenshot showing: Word Document re-converted into a PDF format](/img/how-to-fill-out-pdf-forms_-an-easy-step-by-step-guide-13-.png "Word Document re-converted into a PDF format")
